In addition to our limit of liability, we will pay all defense costs we incur. Our duty to settle or defend ends when our limit of liability for this coverage has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements. We have no duty to defend any suit or settle any claim for "bodily injury" or "property damage" not covered under this policy."</b></p></div><div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 12pt; margin-left: 0.5in; text-align: left;">   <p style="margin: 0 0 12pt 0;"><b><u>CRN TEXT:</u></b></p>   <p style="margin: 0 0 12pt 0;">The subject crash occurred on Friday, March 15, 2024, at approximately 10:30 AM, at the intersection of Fletcher Avenue and Bruce B Downs Boulevard. Vehicle 1, operated by Jason Miller (the insured), was traveling northbound on Bruce B Downs Boulevard, while Vehicle 2, driven by John Smith, was traveling eastbound on Fletcher Avenue in the through lane. The insured failed to stop at a red light, proceeding through the intersection and causing a T-bone collision with Mr. Smith's vehicle. The insured was cited for failing to stop at a red light and careless driving. Mr. Smith was properly restrained, operating his vehicle lawfully with a green light, and no citations were issued against him. Liability rests solely with the insured due to their failure to stop at the red light, and no liability rests with John Smith.</p>   <p style="margin: 0 0 12pt 0;">Mr. Smith received care at multiple facilities including Advent Health Surgery Center, Active Wellness & Rehabilitation Center, and Tampa Bay Imaging. His treatment included physical therapy, orthopedic evaluation, diagnostic imaging such as X-rays and MRIs, and rehabilitation. Diagnoses included cervical strain, thoracic strain, lumbar strain, muscle spasms, and post-traumatic headaches. The medical bills total approximately $7,500.00, with treatment ongoing and pain symptoms persisting.</p>   <p style="margin: 0 0 12pt 0;">Despite numerous opportunities to settle this claim within the policy limits, Progressive has failed to make a good faith effort to resolve the matter. No reasonable offer has been extended. This lack of timely adjustment and refusal to tender the $75,000 BI policy limits has placed their insured, Jason Miller, at significant financial risk.</p>   <p style="margin: 0 0 12pt 0;">John Smith hereby files this Civil Remedy Notice with the opportunity for Progressive to cure the violations within 60 days of receipt. Tender of the full $75,000 policy limits to “Ryan T. Hughes trust account, for the benefit of John Smith” will be considered a full and final settlement of all claims stemming from this incident. Failure to do so may result in a statutory bad faith action pursuant to Florida Statutes, including potential recovery of interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. This CRN serves as formal notice to Progressive of its statutory duties and the consequences of its ongoing inaction.</p></div></body></html>
